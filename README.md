# Self-generated cosmic-ray confinement in TeV halos

## About

Code to compute self-consistently the self-generation of Alfven waves by pairs leaving pulsars. The code solves the time-dependent propagation and diffusion of cosmic rays from a time-dependent source in a regime with both time- and distance-dependent diffusion. We applied this code to show that pulsars can produce localized regions where diffusion is inhibited by 2â€“3 orders of magnitude, consistent with TeV halo observations.
